### `Tech-Stack used in the application:`
1.The application does not use any ## `UI library` as there was no requirement of many complex elements . The application is built
  using native html components.
2.For making API calls ## `axios` has been used . It is not mandatory to use axios ,natyive browser API fetch can be also used.
3.For mainting data state in front end  ## `redux` has been used .## `Redux toolkit` is used for implementing redux.It was decided to use redux as it is something i am familiar with and also it gives more structure to the data flow.  But other alternatives like zustand , recoil can be also used here.
